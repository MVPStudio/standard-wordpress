  # Set all the timeouts to 0 'cause when you do things like upgrade plugins in Wordpress
  # the HTTP requests that give you the status of the upgrade just wait until the upgrade
  # is complete which can be very slow. However, contrary to what the docs say
  # (https://www.getambassador.io/docs/latest/topics/using/timeouts/) a timeout
  # of 0 doesn't disable the timeout; it causes all the ambassador pods to die with errors like:
  #
  # ```
  # Proto constraint validation failed
  # (BootstrapValidationError.StaticResources: ["embedded message failed
  # validation"] | caused by StaticResourcesValidationError.Clusters[i]:
  # ["embedded message failed validation"] | caused by
  # ClusterValidationError.ConnectTimeout: ["value must be greater than "
  # "0s"])
  # ```
  #
  # so we just set it really high

# In the following we set up a host and TLS termination for the www-prefixed variant of the URL but we then set up a
# mapping to redirect the www-prefix to the non-prefix. Note that the 2nd host entry with the TLS cert is required
# otherwise the HTTP headers are encrypted and you can see the Host field to do any routing.
