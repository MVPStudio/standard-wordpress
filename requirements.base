# This file lists the actual, direct dependencies of our setup-script.py.
# If you have another _direct_ dependency add it here, install it into your
# venv and then `pip freeze` to generate a new requirements.txt.
#
# If you aren't developing but just need to get setup-script.py running
# use the frozen requirements.txt file instead.
